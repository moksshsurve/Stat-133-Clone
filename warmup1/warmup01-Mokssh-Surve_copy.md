===============================

-   Oven
-   Donut-shaped pan
-   Blender
-   Offset Spatula
-   Fine-mesh strainer

Recipe:
=======

1.  Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat loaf pan with nonstick baking spray or butter.
2.  Place sugar, salt, lemon zest & butter in a bowl, and mix with an electric mixer.
3.  Add eggs gradually to mix.
4.  Place & mash rasberries in a bowl.
5.  Pour half of the mix on rasberries.
6.  Add sour cream to the other half and beat the mix.
7.  Beat the mix with the rasberries and add some flour.
8.  Place small amounts of both mixes on a baking pan.
9.  Bake cake for an hour.

### *This dish is best enjoyed in the summers due to the fresh and vibrant flavours of the fresh raspberries!*

Variations
----------

*Instead of the raspberry, other vibrant and flavourful fruits like strawberry and lemon can be used for the pound cake!*

Part 3: Euclidean Distance
==========================

\#Definition
------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them **($\\overline{pq}$)**

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$ d(p,q) = d(q,p) = \\sqrt{ {q\_1 - p\_1}^2 + {q\_2 - p\_2}^2 + ... + {q\_n - p\_n}^2 } $$
$$                 = \\sqrt{ \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} {q\_i - p\_i}^2  }. $$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$ \\lVert{p}\\rVert = \\sqrt{ {p\_1}^2 + {p\_2}^2 + ... + {p\_n}^2 } = \\sqrt{p.p} $$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
