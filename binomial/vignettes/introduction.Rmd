## Introduction
The package 'binomial' is a simple yet powerful package that provides users with functions that can be used to solve and display basic probability distributions as plots. Although this package is fairly basic at this point, it has the scope of being expanded to more complex distributions starting with normal distributions, and possibly even automatically generated Discrete Fourier Tranforms (DFT) to fit data.

## Functions

* `bin_choose(n, k)`:  
Calculates the number of combinations of k successes in n trials.  


* `bin_probability(success, trials, prob)`:  
Calculates the probability of getting 'success' successes in 'trials' trials - with 'prob' being the probability of getting a success in 1 trial.  


* `bin_distribution(trials, prob)`:  
Calculates the probability distribution of successes in given no. of trials - with 'prob' being the probability of getting a success in 1 trial. Returns a data frame.  
  + `plot.bindis()`:  
    Graphs a barplot to display the probability histogram of the binomial distribution.  
  

* `bin_cumulative(trials, prob)`:  
Calculates the probability distribution of successes in given no. of trials, and their cumulative - with 'prob' being the probability of getting a success in 1 trial. Returns a data frame.  
  + `plot.bincum()`:  
    Graphs the cumulative distribution of the distribution of succcesses as a line graph.  
    

* `bin_variable(trials, prob)`:  
Creates a binomial variable object, whose summary statistics can be computed by using method 'summary' on the binvar object.
  + `print.binvar()`:  
    Prints the no. of trials and probabiltiy of success of the binomial variable object.  
    
  + `summary.binvar()`:  
    Creates the summary statistics of the binomial variable (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis). 
    
  + `print.summary.binvar()`:  
    Prints the summar characteristics of the binomial variable (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).
  
* `bin_mean()`: mean or expected value of binomial variable.  
* `bin_variance()`: variance of binomial variable. 
* `bin_mode()`: mode of binomial variable. 
* `bin_skewness()`: skewness of binomial variable.  
* `bin_kurtosis()`: kurtosis of binomial variable.  


## Examples & Usage
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library (binomial)

#bin_variable()
#building a binomial variable and seeing characteristics
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3) 
bin1
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1

#bin_choose
bin_choose(5, 0)
bin_choose(5, 1:3)

#bin_probability
# probabilities of getting 2 or less successes in 5 trials (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# 55 heads in 100 tosses of a loaded coin with 45% chance of heads
bin_probability(success = 55, trials = 100, prob = 0.45)

#bin_distribution
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
#plot.bindis()
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5) 
plot(dis1)

#bin_cumulative()
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
#plot.bincum()
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5) 
plot(dis2)
