Description: The package 'binomial' is a simple yet powerful package that provides users with functions that can be used to solve and display basic probability distributions as plots. This package is very basic at this point, but can serve the purpose of carrying out and fitting DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) models to data using built in functions.
