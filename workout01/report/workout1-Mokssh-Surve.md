###5.2) REPORT

#4 YEARS, 3 CHAMPIONSHIPS, ONE TEAM - GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
### *Author: Mokssh Surve*
##### *Date: 13th March, 2019*

It has been on 3 out of 4 occasions in the last 4 years that the Golden State Warriors have overcome the Cleveland Cavaliers in what has often seemed to be a one sided affair with Lebron James, of the Cavs, very unusually coming out on the wrong side of the matchup in the NBA Championship Final games. This one sided affair can be attributed to the Warriors' talismanic attack and prolific record in front of the basket. This unhindered and seemingly flawless attack is backed by a strong set of backup forces when the big guns fail to deliver - and this first-class display by the main front 5 of the Warriors is what will be analysed in this report.




The five players responsible for the Warriors' unwavering consistency in the attack are: *Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green & Andre Iguodala*. 


Below are 3 tables that show the conversion rates of each of the 5 aforementioned GSW Players - an overall breakdown, as well as independent tables for 2 pointers and 3 pointers.

As is seen in the tables above, the Warriors have something that no team in the championship has - a consistent set of 5 players that each can easily bring home 25 points per game on an average day. The Lakers have James (who agreed could be as valuable as 2 of these guys), Celtics have Irving and the Bucks have Giannis, but the Warriors have an army of 5 who can in unison can almost guarantee a 100 points per game.
