### 5.2) REPORT

4 YEARS, 3 CHAMPIONSHIPS, ONE TEAM - GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
==========================================================

### *Author: Mokssh Surve*

##### *Date: 13th March, 2019*

It has been on 3 out of 4 occasions in the last 4 years that the Golden State Warriors have overcome the Cleveland Cavaliers in what has often seemed to be a one sided affair with Lebron James, of the Cavs, very unusually coming out on the wrong side of the matchup in the NBA Championship Final games. This one sided affair can be attributed to the Warriors' talismanic attack and prolific record in front of the basket. This unhindered and seemingly flawless attack is backed by a strong set of backup forces when the big guns fail to deliver - and this first-class display by the main front 5 of the Warriors is what will be analysed in this report.

![The Super 5](/Users/moksshsurve/Desktop/warriors-image.png) The five players responsible for the Warriors' unwavering consistency in the attack are: *Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green & Andre Iguodala*. [1]

Below are 3 tables that show the conversion rates of each of the 5 aforementioned GSW Players - an overall breakdown, as well as independent tables for 2 pointers and 3 pointers.

`All Shots`

| Name             | Total | Made | perc\_made |
|------------------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 Kevin Durant   | 915   | 495  | 0.541      |
| 2 Andre Iguodala | 371   | 192  | 0.518      |
| 3 Klay Thompson  | 1220  | 575  | 0.471      |
| 4 Stephen Curry  | 1250  | 584  | 0.467      |
| 5 Draymond Green | 578   | 245  | 0.424      |

`2 Pointers`

| Name             | Total | Made | perc\_made |
|------------------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 Andre Iguodala | 210   | 134  | 0.638      |
| 2 Kevin Durant   | 643   | 390  | 0.607      |
| 3 Stephen Curry  | 563   | 304  | 0.540      |
| 4 Klay Thompson  | 640   | 329  | 0.514      |
| 5 Draymond Green | 360   | 171  | 0.494      |

`3 Pointers`

| Name             | Total | Made | Percentage |
|------------------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 Klay Thompson  | 580   | 246  | 0.424      |
| 2 Stephen Curry  | 687   | 280  | 0.408      |
| 3 Kevin Durant   | 272   | 105  | 0.386      |
| 4 Andre Iguodala | 161   | 58   | 0.360      |
| 5 Draymond Green | 232   | 74   | 0.319      |

As is seen in the tables above, the Warriors have something that no team in the championship has - a consistent set of 5 players that each can easily bring home 25 points per game on an average day. The Lakers have James (who agreed could be as valuable as 2 of these guys), Celtics have Irving and the Bucks have Giannis, but the Warriors have an army of 5 who can in unison can almost guarantee a 100 points per game. Whether it is Curry and Thompson who batter the opposity with their 3s, or it is Durant and Iguodala who do their bit with the 2 point field goals, the Warriors' complement each other to form an attack that is more wholesome than most we've seen in the history of the NBA. In fact, with a 49.5% overall Field Goal Completion rate, the Warriors after the 2016 season ended up being the most prolific shooters in the history of the National Basketball Agency! [2]

It is notable that it is not only the quantum, but also the areas on the court from which these players score. To put it into perspective, the shot charts for each of these players is displayed below in order to highlight the versatility and the ubiquitous nature of the Warriors' attack - its like an all encompassing tsunami rushing down on the other team when they're on the attack.

### SO.... HOW ARE TEAMS SUPPOSED TO STOP THEM?

The Warriors have been the team to beat for the past 4.5 years, and have gone on winning runs unparalleled by any other team - probably only matched by the Lakers team with Bryant and Shaq in their primes. Teams have tried to tactically finesse their way past this team, but have failed to do so. The purchase of Durant in 2016 meant the Warriors moving further away from the rest of the pack, but the Cavs outclassed them to come 0-3 from behind to win the championship earlier that same year by frustrating their attack and carrying out a man-to-man marking where they placed bigger guys on the Warriors' attack - this was however before Durant was purchased.

From a very simplistic point of view, the simplest way to stop the Warriors' unstoppable attack is to build up as holistic a defense or defensive mechanism in order to keep their shots out. Otherwise, you can find yourself getting blown away 4-0 and 4-1 like the Cavs were in the last 2 NBA Championship Finals.
